Perform the following preprocessing steps
8. Replace missing value with mode or means.
9. Convert vitamins, shelf to nominal attribute.
10. Design a Linear regression model to predict the rating of a cereal based on all nutrients. Tabulate 
the accuracy of the model using 
c. 80 % , 20 % split
d. Using cross validation.
11. Use select attributes tab and CfsSubsetEval to identify the top 5 related nutrients.
12. Design a Linear regression model to predict the rating of a cereal based on top 5 related nutrients. 
Tabulate the accuracy of the model using 
c. 80 % , 20 % split
d. Using cross validation.
13. Discretise rating into 5 bins using the filters. 
14. Design a Logistic regression model to predict the rating of a cereal based on top 5 related 
nutrients. Tabulate the accuracy of the model using 
c. 70 % , 30 % split
d. Using cross validation.
Exer 2: Using the SUPERMARKET.ARFF data set and WEKA to answer the following 
questions:
1.Split the dataset into 2 datasets , 1 containing items and the other containing departments. 
2.For the item data set, find the 5 most frequent itemsets ranked as per support. 
3. Which are the top 5 selling items in the dataset ? 
4. For the top selling item, find association rules with the item on the RHS of the rule. Tabulate 
the support, confidence and lift of the rule. 
5. Find top 5 association rules for the department store. Tabulate the support, confidence and lift 
of the rule.
