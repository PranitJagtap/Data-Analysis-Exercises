Exer 1: 
Use the “employment.csv” data set and perform time series analysis and visualization through the 
following questions. 
1. Convert datestamp column to a datetime object and Set the datestamp columns as the index of 
your DataFrame. Check if there are missing values in each column.
2. Generate a boxplot to find the distribution of unemployment rate for every industry .
3. Using line chart Visualize the unemployment rate of workers by industry .

Exer 2: 
Use the ”groceries.csv” dataset and answer the following:

['whole milk']]
3. Use Python library mlxtend and convert the transactions into a format that can be used in the

pip install mlxtend
from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
4. Find top selling items with minimum support of 2%.
5. Find all frequent itemsets with minimum support of 5%.

7. Find the top 10 association rules with minimum support of 2%, sorted by confidence in 
descending order.
8. Find association rules with minimum support of 2% and lift of more than 1.0.
