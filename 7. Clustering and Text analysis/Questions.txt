Exer 1: Clustering
Download the data set “Online Retail.xlsx” from 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail
a. Read and write a summary of the metadata .
b. Select only the transactions that have occurred from 01/04/ 2011 and 
09/12/2011 and create a dataset.
c. Calculate the RFM values for each customer (by customer id). RFM 
represents:
2. R (Recency) − Recency should be calculated as the number of months before he or 
she has made a purchase from the online store. If he/she made a purchase in the 
month of December 2011, then the Recency should be 0. If purchase is made in 
November 2011 then Recency should be 1 and so on and so forth.
3. F (Frequency) − Number of invoices by the customer from 01/04/ 2011 and 
09/12/2011.
4. M (Monetary Value) − Total spend by the customer from 01/04/ 2011 and 
09/12/2011.
a. Use the elbow method to identify how many customer segments exist, using 
the RFM
5. values for each customer.
a. Create the customer segments with K-means algorithm by using number of 
clusters is suggested by elbow method.
6. from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
a. Plot the clusters in a scatter plot and mark each segment differently using 
lmplot.
b. Print the cluster centers of each customer segment and explain them 
intuitively.
c. Create the customer segments with Agglomerative algorithm by using number 
of clusters is suggested by elbow method.
7. from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
a. Visualize the clusters using the dendrogram.
b. Compare the clusters obtained using KMeans vs. Agglomeration.

Exer 2: Text Analysis
Download the amazon_baby.zip file and answer the following:
12. Check the number of the reviews received for each product.
13. Check the products that have more than 15 reviews.
14. Find any missing review are present or not, If present remove those data.
15. Clean the data and remove the special characters and replace the contractions with its 
expansion by converting the uppercase character to lower case. Also, remove the 
punctuations.
16. Add the Polarity, length of the review, the word count and average word length of 
each review.
17. Visualize the distribution of the word count, review length, and polarity.
18. Visualize polarity considering the rating.
19. Visualize the count of the reviews of each rating available in the dataset.
20. List the Top 20 products based on the polarity.
21. Visualize to check whether the review length changes with rating.
22. Visualize the distribution of Top 25 Unigram, Bigram and Trigram
